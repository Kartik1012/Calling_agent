            "On carefully analysing these examples, following are the critiques related to prompt Your prompt is well-structured, but there are a few areas where it could be improved to avoid misclassifications like the one you mentioned. Here are some detailed feedback points:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Ambiguity in Mixed Queries**:\n",
            "   <START> The instruction states that if a question combines factual data requests with opinion components, it should always choose `sql_generation`. However, the example question \"What is ABC's view on Tesla's valuation?\" primarily seeks an opinion (ABC's view) rather than a specific data point. This creates confusion about whether to classify it as `general_qa` or `sql_generation`. The instruction could clarify that if the primary focus is on an opinion, even if it mentions a company or valuation, it should lean towards `general_qa`. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Lack of Clear Definitions**:\n",
            "   <START> The definitions of `sql_generation` and `general_qa` could be more distinct. For instance, the term \"valuation\" can be interpreted in both contexts: as a specific data point (which could lead to `sql_generation`) or as a request for an opinion (which would lead to `general_qa`). Providing clearer boundaries or examples for terms like \"valuation\" could help in making more accurate classifications. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Overlapping Criteria**:\n",
            "   <START> The criteria for classifying queries into `sql_generation` and `general_qa` overlap in some areas, particularly when it comes to questions that ask for explanations or interpretations. The instruction could benefit from a more hierarchical approach, where certain keywords or phrases are prioritized over others to reduce ambiguity. For example, if a question contains \"view\" or \"opinion,\" it could be classified as `general_qa` regardless of other factors. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Handling of Direct Queries**:\n",
            "   <START> The instruction for classifying `direct` queries could be more explicit. It currently states that if the query is a greeting or irrelevant, it should be classified as `direct`. However, it does not provide examples of what constitutes an \"irrelevant question.\" Including examples of common greetings or irrelevant queries could help in making this classification clearer. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Response Structure**:\n",
            "   <START> The output JSON structure is clear, but the instruction could specify how to handle cases where the classification is uncertain. For example, if a query is ambiguous and could fit into multiple categories, it might be helpful to include a field in the JSON output that indicates the uncertainty or reasoning behind the classification. This could aid in refining the model's understanding over time. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "By addressing these points, you can enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your zero-shot instruction, leading to more accurate classifications in the future.\n",
            "Use the critique smartly, refine the current prompt to make sure we dont get these examples wrong.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. <START> **Mixed Queries Handling**: The prompt states that when a question combines factual data requests with opinion components, it should default to \"sql_generation.\" In this case, the question asks for ABC's view (an opinion) on Tesla's valuation (a specific data point). The instruction should emphasize that if a specific company’s valuation is being requested alongside an opinion, it should be classified as \"sql_generation.\" <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. <START> **Ambiguity in Classification**: The prompt mentions that if uncertain between the two categories, it should default to \"sql_generation.\" However, the example question is ambiguous because it asks for an opinion on a specific valuation. The instruction could clarify that any request for a specific valuation, even if it includes an opinion, should lean towards \"sql_generation.\" <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. <START> **Clarification of Terms**: The term \"valuation\" is mentioned in both categories, but it is more aligned with \"sql_generation\" when it pertains to specific financial metrics. The prompt could benefit from explicitly stating that any mention of valuation in the context of a specific company should trigger \"sql_generation.\" <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. <START> **Examples and Edge Cases**: The prompt could include more examples of mixed queries and how they should be classified. Providing clear examples of similar questions and their correct classifications would help the model better understand the nuances of mixed queries. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. <START> **Reinforcement of Key Terms**: The prompt could reinforce the importance of identifying key terms that indicate a request for specific data points. For instance, terms like \"valuation,\" \"price,\" or \"market cap\" should trigger \"sql_generation\" even if they are part of a broader question. <END>\n",

Here are the reasons why the example question \"What is ABC's view on Tesla's valuation?\" was classified incorrectly as \"general_qa\":\n",
            "\n",
            "1. <START> **Mixed Queries Handling**: The prompt states that when a question combines factual data requests with opinion components, it should default to \"sql_generation.\" In this case, the question asks for ABC's view (an opinion) on Tesla's valuation (a specific data point). The instruction should emphasize that if a specific company’s valuation is being requested alongside an opinion, it should be classified as \"sql_generation.\" <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. <START> **Ambiguity in Classification**: The prompt mentions that if uncertain between the two categories, it should default to \"sql_generation.\" However, the example question is ambiguous because it asks for an opinion on a specific valuation. The instruction could clarify that any request for a specific valuation, even if it includes an opinion, should lean towards \"sql_generation.\" <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. <START> **Clarification of Terms**: The term \"valuation\" is mentioned in both categories, but it is more aligned with \"sql_generation\" when it pertains to specific financial metrics. The prompt could benefit from explicitly stating that any mention of valuation in the context of a specific company should trigger \"sql_generation.\" <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. <START> **Examples and Edge Cases**: The prompt could include more examples of mixed queries and how they should be classified. Providing clear examples of similar questions and their correct classifications would help the model better understand the nuances of mixed queries. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. <START> **Reinforcement of Key Terms**: The prompt could reinforce the importance of identifying key terms that indicate a request for specific data points. For instance, terms like \"valuation,\" \"price,\" or \"market cap\" should trigger \"sql_generation\" even if they are part of a broader question. <END>\n",
            "\n",

However, the instruction may not have emphasized the importance of security status clearly enough. <END>\n",

The instruction might not have adequately highlighted the significance of list requests in the context of data queries. <END>\n",

            "3. <START> The instruction mentions that if a question is ambiguous, the default should be `sql_generation`. The example question is straightforward and does not present ambiguity; therefore, it should have been classified as `sql_generation` without hesitation. The instruction could have reinforced the idea that clear requests for data should always be prioritized. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. <START> The instruction does not explicitly state that queries asking for lists of items (like stocks) should always be classified as `sql_generation`. This could lead to confusion in classification, especially if the agent misinterprets the request as potentially requiring analysis. A clearer directive on list requests would help avoid misclassification. <END>\n",

            "\n",
            "3. **Check for Database Fields**: The query explicitly mentions \"Apple Inc.\", which is a company name. This indicates that the question is related to a specific entity within our securities database.\n",
