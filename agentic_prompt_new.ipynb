            "\n",
            "1. **Ambiguity in Query Type Definitions**:\n",
            "   - The definition of **sql_generation** states that it should be used for queries asking for specific values, lists, or comparisons. However, the example \"Which companies have buy ratings?\" is a request for a specific list of companies, which fits the criteria for **sql_generation**. \n",
            "   - <START> The definitions for **sql_generation** may not be explicitly clear enough to cover all scenarios where a list is requested. The phrase \"specific values, lists, or comparisons\" should be emphasized more strongly to ensure that queries asking for lists are clearly classified as **sql_generation**. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Mixed Queries Handling**:\n",
            "   - The prompt mentions that mixed queries (data + opinion) should always be classified as **sql_generation**. However, the example does not contain an opinion component, which may lead to confusion in classification.\n",
            "   - <START> The handling of mixed queries should be clarified to ensure that if a query is purely factual (like asking for a list of companies with buy ratings), it should still be classified as **sql_generation** without needing to consider opinion components. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Examples and Clarifications**:\n",
            "   - The prompt could benefit from more examples that illustrate the boundaries between the categories, especially for **sql_generation** and **general_qa**. \n",
            "   - <START> Providing additional examples that clearly demonstrate the classification of queries, especially those that are borderline, would help in reducing misclassifications. For instance, showing that \"Which companies have buy ratings?\" is a straightforward request for data would reinforce the correct classification. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Explicit Mention of Ratings**:\n",
            "   - The prompt does mention \"Rating data\" under **sql_generation**, but it could be more explicit about how queries specifically related to ratings should be classified.\n",
            "   - <START> The definition for **sql_generation** should explicitly state that any query asking for ratings (e.g., \"buy ratings\") is a clear indicator for classification as **sql_generation**. This would help in ensuring that such queries are not misclassified. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Clarification on Out-of-Scope Queries**:\n",
            "   - The handling of out-of-scope queries is clear, but the distinction between out-of-scope and general queries could be more defined.\n",
            "   - <START> It would be beneficial to clarify that out-of-scope queries should not be confused with general queries that seek analysis or opinions.

Here are the reasons why the example you provided was classified incorrectly, along with suggestions for improvement:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Ambiguity in Query Type Definitions**:\n",
            "   - The definition of **sql_generation** states that it should be used for queries asking for specific values, lists, or comparisons. However, the example \"Which companies have buy ratings?\" is a request for a specific list of companies, which fits the criteria for **sql_generation**. \n",
            "   - <START> The definitions for **sql_generation** may not be explicitly clear enough to cover all scenarios where a list is requested. The phrase \"specific values, lists, or comparisons\" should be emphasized more strongly to ensure that queries asking for lists are clearly classified as **sql_generation**. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Mixed Queries Handling**:\n",
            "   - The prompt mentions that mixed queries (data + opinion) should always be classified as **sql_generation**. However, the example does not contain an opinion component, which may lead to confusion in classification.\n",
            "   - <START> The handling of mixed queries should be clarified to ensure that if a query is purely factual (like asking for a list of companies with buy ratings), it should still be classified as **sql_generation** without needing to consider opinion components. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Examples and Clarifications**:\n",
            "   - The prompt could benefit from more examples that illustrate the boundaries between the categories, especially for **sql_generation** and **general_qa**. \n",
            "   - <START> Providing additional examples that clearly demonstrate the classification of queries, especially those that are borderline, would help in reducing misclassifications. For instance, showing that \"Which companies have buy ratings?\" is a straightforward request for data would reinforce the correct classification. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Explicit Mention of Ratings**:\n",
            "   - The prompt does mention \"Rating data\" under **sql_generation**, but it could be more explicit about how queries specifically related to ratings should be classified.\n",
            "   - <START> The definition for **sql_generation** should explicitly state that any query asking for ratings (e.g., \"buy ratings\") is a clear indicator for classification as **sql_generation**. This would help in ensuring that such queries are not misclassified. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Clarification on Out-of-Scope Queries**:\n",
            "   - The handling of out-of-scope queries is clear, but the distinction between out-of-scope and general queries could be more defined.\n",
            "   - <START> It would be beneficial to clarify that out-of-scope queries should not be confused with general queries that seek analysis or opinions. This distinction can help in ensuring that queries like \"Which companies have buy ratings?\" are not misclassified as out-of-scope. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "By addressing these areas, you can improve the accuracy of the classification process and ensure that queries are categorized correctly based on the definitions provided.\n",
            "Use the critique smartly, refine the current prompt to make sure we dont get these examples wrong.\n",

            " Here are the detailed feedback points regarding the instruction and the specific example provided:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Ambiguity in Query Classification**:\n",
            "   <START> The instruction does not clearly define how to handle queries that may have both factual and opinion-based components. In the example, \"How does inflation impact equity market?\" the question seeks an analysis of the relationship between inflation and the equity market, which is inherently an opinion-based inquiry. However, it also implies a factual basis regarding the impact of inflation, which could lead to confusion in classification. The instruction should emphasize that if a question asks \"how\" or \"why,\" it leans more towards general analysis, even if it touches on factual elements. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Lack of Clear Distinction for Analysis Requests**:\n",
            "   <START> The definitions for 'general_qa' and 'sql_generation' could be more distinct. The instruction states that 'general_qa' is for analysis and opinions, but it does not explicitly state that questions asking for the effects or impacts of certain factors (like inflation) should be classified as 'general_qa'. This lack of clarity can lead to misclassification, as seen in the example. The instruction should clarify that any question seeking to understand the implications of a factor on a market or sector should be classified as 'general_qa'. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Mixed Queries Handling**:\n",
            "   <START> The instruction mentions that mixed queries should always be classified as 'sql_generation', but it does not provide a clear guideline on how to identify when a query is mixed. In the example, the question could be interpreted as mixed because it asks for an understanding of a relationship (factual) while also seeking an opinion on the impact (analytical). The instruction should provide more explicit criteria for identifying mixed queries to avoid misclassification. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Defaulting to 'sql_generation'**:\n",
            "   <START> The instruction states that in ambiguous cases, the default should be 'sql_generation'. This could lead to misclassifications when the query is clearly seeking an opinion or analysis. In the example, the question is not ambiguous; it clearly seeks an analysis of the impact of inflation on the equity market. The instruction should encourage a more nuanced approach to classification, where the intent of the question is prioritized over the default classification. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Examples and Clarifications**:\n",
            "   <START> The instruction lacks specific examples that illustrate the classification process. Providing examples of similar questions and their classifications would help clarify the intent behind each category. For instance, including examples of questions that are clearly 'general_qa' versus those that are 'sql_generation' would help in understanding the nuances of classification. <END>\n",

            "On carefully analysing these examples, following are the critiques related to prompt Here are the detailed feedback points regarding the instruction and the specific example provided:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Ambiguity in Query Classification**:\n",
            "   <START> The instruction does not clearly define how to handle queries that may have both factual and opinion-based components. In the example, \"How does inflation impact equity market?\" the question seeks an analysis of the relationship between inflation and the equity market, which is inherently an opinion-based inquiry. However, it also implies a factual basis regarding the impact of inflation, which could lead to confusion in classification. The instruction should emphasize that if a question asks \"how\" or \"why,\" it leans more towards general analysis, even if it touches on factual elements. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Lack of Clear Distinction for Analysis Requests**:\n",
            "   <START> The definitions for 'general_qa' and 'sql_generation' could be more distinct. The instruction states that 'general_qa' is for analysis and opinions, but it does not explicitly state that questions asking for the effects or impacts of certain factors (like inflation) should be classified as 'general_qa'. This lack of clarity can lead to misclassification, as seen in the example. The instruction should clarify that any question seeking to understand the implications of a factor on a market or sector should be classified as 'general_qa'. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Mixed Queries Handling**:\n",
            "   <START> The instruction mentions that mixed queries should always be classified as 'sql_generation', but it does not provide a clear guideline on how to identify when a query is mixed. In the example, the question could be interpreted as mixed because it asks for an understanding of a relationship (factual) while also seeking an opinion on the impact (analytical). The instruction should provide more explicit criteria for identifying mixed queries to avoid misclassification. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Defaulting to 'sql_generation'**:\n",
            "   <START> The instruction states that in ambiguous cases, the default should be 'sql_generation'. This could lead to misclassifications when the query is clearly seeking an opinion or analysis. In the example, the question is not ambiguous; it clearly seeks an analysis of the impact of inflation on the equity market. The instruction should encourage a more nuanced approach to classification, where the intent of the question is prioritized over the default classification. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Examples and Clarifications**:\n",
            "   <START> The instruction lacks specific examples that illustrate the classification process. Providing examples of similar questions and their classifications would help clarify the intent behind each category. For instance, including examples of questions that are clearly 'general_qa' versus those that are 'sql_generation' would help in understanding the nuances of classification. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "By addressing these points, the instruction can be refined to improve the accuracy of query classification and ensure that the AI assistant responds appropriately to user inquiries.\n",

However, there are a few areas where the instruction could be improved to avoid misclassifications, such as the example you provided regarding the impact of inflation on the equity market. Here are the reasons for the misclassification, wrapped as requested:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. <START> **Ambiguity in Definitions**: The definitions for `general_qa` and `sql_generation` may overlap in certain contexts, particularly when a question can be interpreted in multiple ways. In the case of \"How does inflation impact equity market?\", the question could be seen as seeking an opinion or analysis (which would fit `general_qa`), but it also implies a request for factual data about the relationship between inflation and equity markets. The prompt could clarify that questions about the effects of economic factors on markets should be classified as `general_qa` unless they explicitly request specific data points. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. <START> **Mixed Queries Handling**: The instruction states that mixed queries (data + opinion) should always be classified as `sql_generation`. However, the example question does not explicitly request data but rather seeks an analysis of the impact of inflation. This could lead to confusion about whether it should be classified as `general_qa` or `sql_generation`. The prompt could benefit from clearer guidelines on how to handle questions that are primarily analytical but may also imply a need for data. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. <START> **Defaulting to sql_generation**: The instruction mentions that if uncertain between the two categories, one should default to `sql_generation`. This could lead to misclassifications when the question is clearly seeking an opinion or analysis. In the example, the question is asking for an explanation of a relationship rather than a specific data point, which should have led to a classification of `general_qa`. The prompt could specify that defaulting to `sql_generation` should only occur when the question explicitly requests data. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. <START> **Clarification on Economic Impact Questions**: The prompt does not explicitly address how to classify questions that inquire about the impact of economic factors (like inflation) on markets. It would be beneficial to include a specific guideline that questions about the effects of economic conditions on market behavior should be classified as `general_qa`, as they inherently seek analysis and interpretation. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. <START> **Examples and Counterexamples**: The prompt could include more examples and counterexamples to illustrate the classification process better. For instance, providing a clear distinction between a question that asks for a specific data point (e.g., \"What is the current inflation rate?\") versus one that seeks an analysis (e.g., \"How does inflation impact equity market?\") would help clarify the classification criteria. <END>\n",
            "\n",

            "On carefully analysing these examples, following are the critiques related to prompt The prompt you provided has a clear structure and guidelines for classifying user queries into three categories: `sql_generation`, `general_qa`, and `direct`. However, there are a few areas where the instruction could be improved to avoid misclassifications, such as the example you provided regarding the impact of inflation on the equity market. Here are the reasons for the misclassification, wrapped as requested:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. <START> **Ambiguity in Definitions**: The definitions for `general_qa` and `sql_generation` may overlap in certain contexts, particularly when a question can be interpreted in multiple ways. In the case of \"How does inflation impact equity market?\", the question could be seen as seeking an opinion or analysis (which would fit `general_qa`), but it also implies a request for factual data about the relationship between inflation and equity markets. The prompt could clarify that questions about the effects of economic factors on markets should be classified as `general_qa` unless they explicitly request specific data points. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. <START> **Mixed Queries Handling**: The instruction states that mixed queries (data + opinion) should always be classified as `sql_generation`. However, the example question does not explicitly request data but rather seeks an analysis of the impact of inflation. This could lead to confusion about whether it should be classified as `general_qa` or `sql_generation`. The prompt could benefit from clearer guidelines on how to handle questions that are primarily analytical but may also imply a need for data. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. <START> **Defaulting to sql_generation**: The instruction mentions that if uncertain between the two categories, one should default to `sql_generation`. This could lead to misclassifications when the question is clearly seeking an opinion or analysis. In the example, the question is asking for an explanation of a relationship rather than a specific data point, which should have led to a classification of `general_qa`. The prompt could specify that defaulting to `sql_generation` should only occur when the question explicitly requests data. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. <START> **Clarification on Economic Impact Questions**: The prompt does not explicitly address how to classify questions that inquire about the impact of economic factors (like inflation) on markets. It would be beneficial to include a specific guideline that questions about the effects of economic conditions on market behavior should be classified as `general_qa`, as they inherently seek analysis and interpretation. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. <START> **Examples and Counterexamples**: The prompt could include more examples and counterexamples to illustrate the classification process better. For instance, providing a clear distinction between a question that asks for a specific data point (e.g., \"What is the current inflation rate?\") versus one that seeks an analysis (e.g., \"How does inflation impact equity market?\") would help clarify the classification criteria. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "By addressing these areas, the prompt can be refined to improve the accuracy of query classification and reduce the likelihood of misclassifications like the one in your example.\n",
            "Use the critique smartly, refine the current prompt to make sure we dont get these examples wrong.\n",

            " Here’s a detailed feedback analysis of the prompt based on the provided example:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Misclassification of Query Type**:\n",
            "   - The question \"Which companies have buy ratings?\" is a request for specific data points regarding companies and their ratings. According to the definitions provided, this should be classified as `sql_generation` because it asks for a list of companies with a specific rating (Buy). However, if the response was incorrectly classified, it indicates a failure in the classification logic.\n",
            "   - <START> The instruction may not have clearly emphasized that any request for specific values or lists, especially related to ratings, should be classified as `sql_generation`. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Ambiguity in Definitions**:\n",
            "   - The definitions for `sql_generation` and `general_qa` may not be distinct enough, leading to confusion in classification. The prompt states that mixed queries should always be classified as `sql_generation`, but it does not explicitly state that a straightforward request for a list of companies with a specific rating is also a `sql_generation` query.\n",
            "   - <START> The definitions could benefit from clearer examples that explicitly state that requests for lists or specific data points (like ratings) are always `sql_generation`, regardless of the context. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Lack of Emphasis on Specificity**:\n",
            "   - The prompt does not sufficiently stress the importance of identifying keywords in the user’s query that indicate a request for specific data. In this case, the term \"buy ratings\" is a clear indicator that the user is looking for specific information from the database.\n",
            "   - <START> The instruction should highlight the need to look for specific keywords or phrases that indicate a request for data points, which would help in correctly classifying such queries. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Inadequate Handling of Mixed Queries**:\n",
            "   - The instruction mentions that mixed queries should be classified as `sql_generation`, but it does not clarify that even a single aspect of the query (like asking for a list of companies) can qualify it as such. The example provided does not combine data with opinion, yet it may have been misclassified due to a misunderstanding of the query type.\n",
            "   - <START> The instruction should clarify that any query that requests specific data points, even if it does not explicitly combine data with opinion, should be classified as `sql_generation`. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Generalization of Query Types**:\n",
            "   - The instruction may be too generalized, leading to misinterpretation of specific queries. The classification rules should be more precise to avoid ambiguity in determining the query type.\n",
            "   - <START> The instruction should provide more specific criteria for classification, ensuring that queries like \"Which companies have buy ratings?\" are clearly understood as `sql_generation` due to their nature of requesting specific data. <END>\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "On carefully analysing these examples, following are the critiques related to prompt Here’s a detailed feedback analysis of the prompt based on the provided example:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Misclassification of Query Type**:\n",
            "   - The question \"Which companies have buy ratings?\" is a request for specific data points regarding companies and their ratings. According to the definitions provided, this should be classified as `sql_generation` because it asks for a list of companies with a specific rating (Buy). However, if the response was incorrectly classified, it indicates a failure in the classification logic.\n",
            "   - <START> The instruction may not have clearly emphasized that any request for specific values or lists, especially related to ratings, should be classified as `sql_generation`. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Ambiguity in Definitions**:\n",
            "   - The definitions for `sql_generation` and `general_qa` may not be distinct enough, leading to confusion in classification. The prompt states that mixed queries should always be classified as `sql_generation`, but it does not explicitly state that a straightforward request for a list of companies with a specific rating is also a `sql_generation` query.\n",
            "   - <START> The definitions could benefit from clearer examples that explicitly state that requests for lists or specific data points (like ratings) are always `sql_generation`, regardless of the context. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Lack of Emphasis on Specificity**:\n",
            "   - The prompt does not sufficiently stress the importance of identifying keywords in the user’s query that indicate a request for specific data. In this case, the term \"buy ratings\" is a clear indicator that the user is looking for specific information from the database.\n",
            "   - <START> The instruction should highlight the need to look for specific keywords or phrases that indicate a request for data points, which would help in correctly classifying such queries. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Inadequate Handling of Mixed Queries**:\n",
            "   - The instruction mentions that mixed queries should be classified as `sql_generation`, but it does not clarify that even a single aspect of the query (like asking for a list of companies) can qualify it as such. The example provided does not combine data with opinion, yet it may have been misclassified due to a misunderstanding of the query type.\n",
            "   - <START> The instruction should clarify that any query that requests specific data points, even if it does not explicitly combine data with opinion, should be classified as `sql_generation`. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Generalization of Query Types**:\n",
            "   - The instruction may be too generalized, leading to misinterpretation of specific queries. The classification rules should be more precise to avoid ambiguity in determining the query type.\n",
            "   - <START> The instruction should provide more specific criteria for classification, ensuring that queries like \"Which companies have buy ratings?\" are clearly understood as `sql_generation` due to their nature of requesting specific data. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "By addressing these points, the prompt can be refined to improve the accuracy of query classification and ensure that similar queries are handled correctly in the future.\n",
            "Use the critique smartly, refine the current prompt to make sure we dont get these examples wrong.\n",
            "Based on the above information, Now I want you to write 1 different improved prompts.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Identify the Query Components**: The user is asking for two specific data points: the price target and the current market cap of Amazon. Both of these are quantitative financial metrics.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Recognize the Data Types**: \n",
            "   - **Price Target**: This is a specific financial metric that indicates the expected future price of a security.\n",
            "   - **Market Cap**: This is another financial metric that represents the total market value of a company's outstanding shares.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Check for Database Field Names**: The query explicitly mentions \"Amazon,\" which is a company name. This indicates that the user is looking for data related to a specific entity in the securities database.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Determine the Nature of the Request**: The user is not asking for an opinion, analysis, or interpretation. Instead, they are requesting factual data points that can be retrieved from a database.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Assess the Query Against Definitions**: According to the definitions provided:\n",
            "   - The query fits the 'sql_generation' category because it requests specific values (price target and market cap) without any analytical or opinion-based components.\n",
            "   - It involves a request for current data points related to a specific company.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Identify the Query Type**: The first step is to determine what the user is asking for. The user is requesting a list of stocks that are currently suspended and specifically mentions the technology sector.\n",

            "2. **Analyze the Content of the Query**:\n",
            "   - The phrase \"suspended stocks\" indicates a request for specific data points related to the status of stocks.\n",

            "\n",
            "5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the query clearly fits the criteria for **sql_generation** because it is asking for specific data (suspended stocks) filtered by a particular category (technology sector).\n",

            "1. **Identify the Query Components**: The user is asking for two specific data points: the price target and the current market cap of Amazon. Both of these are quantitative financial metrics.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Recognize the Data Types**: \n",
            "   - **Price Target**: This is a specific financial metric that indicates the expected future price of a security.\n",
            "   - **Market Cap**: This is another financial metric that represents the total market value of a company's outstanding shares.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Check for Database Field Names**: The query explicitly mentions \"Amazon,\" which is a company name. This indicates that the user is looking for data related to a specific entity in the securities database.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Determine the Nature of the Request**: The user is not asking for an opinion, analysis, or interpretation. Instead, they are requesting factual data points that can be retrieved from a database.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Assess the Query Against Definitions**: According to the definitions provided:\n",
            "   - The query fits the 'sql_generation' category because it requests specific values (price target and market cap) without any analytical or opinion-based components.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Identify the Query Type**: The first step is to determine what the user is asking for. The user is requesting a list of stocks that are currently suspended and specifically mentions the technology sector.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Analyze the Content of the Query**:\n",
            "   - The phrase \"suspended stocks\" indicates a request for specific data points related to the status of stocks.\n",
            "   - The mention of \"technology sector\" suggests a filtering criterion based on industry classification.\n",

            "3. **Match with Definitions**:\n",
            "   - According to the definitions provided, a query falls under the **sql_generation** category if it requests specific data points from the securities database, which includes:\n",
            "     - Security status (in this case, \"suspended\").\n",

            "\n",
            "4. **Determine the Nature of the Request**:\n",
            "   - The user is not asking for an opinion, analysis, or interpretation; they are looking for factual data (a list of stocks).\n",

            "\n",
            "5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the query clearly fits the criteria for **sql_generation** because it is asking for specific data (suspended stocks) filtered by a particular category (technology sector).\n",
