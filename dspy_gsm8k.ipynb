            "Billy starts with 8 mice. Each of these mice has 6 pups, so the total number of pups from the first generation is 8 * 6 = 48 pups. After the pups grow up, there are now 8 adult mice and 48 grown pups, making a total of 56 adult mice. Each of these 56 adult mice then has another 6 pups, resulting in 56 * 6 = 336 new pups. Now, there are 56 adult mice and 336 pups, totaling 392 mice. However, due to overcrowding, each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups. Since there are 56 adult mice, they eat a total of 56 * 2 = 112 pups. Therefore, the total number of mice left is 392 - 112 = 280 mice.\n",

The amount over $1000 is $1400 - $1000 = $400. The discount on this amount is 10% of $400, which is $40. Therefore, the total cost after the discount is $1400 - $40 = $1360.\n",
