Here are some detailed feedback points:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Ambiguity in Query Interpretation**:\n",
            "   <START> The instruction does not specify how to handle cases where the query might have multiple interpretations. For example, \"what is the price of apple?\" could refer to different tables or columns if the schema is not clear. The agent may need more guidance on how to prioritize or clarify ambiguous queries. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Lack of Contextual Understanding**:\n",
            "   <START> The prompt does not emphasize the importance of understanding the context of the query. The agent should be instructed to consider the meaning behind the question and the relationships between tables if applicable. This could help in constructing a more accurate SQL query. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Error in SQL Syntax**:\n",
            "   <START> The generated SQL query contains syntax errors, such as missing quotes and incorrect use of the `ORDER BY` clause. The instruction should emphasize the importance of writing syntactically correct SQL and perhaps include a step for validating the SQL syntax before finalizing the output. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Focus on Relevant Columns**:\n",
            "   <START> The instruction mentions focusing on relevant columns but does not provide a clear method for determining which columns are relevant. The agent should be guided to explicitly identify and select the columns that directly relate to the query, ensuring that unnecessary columns are not included. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Output Format Specification**:\n",
            "   <START> While the prompt mentions matching the output format, it does not provide specific examples of expected output types. Including examples of different output formats (e.g., single value, list, etc.) could help the agent understand how to structure the final output more effectively. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Handling Special Cases**:\n",
            "   <START> The generated SQL includes a case statement for handling suspended securities, which may not be relevant to the original query about the price of an apple. The instruction should clarify when to include such special cases and when to focus solely on the requested data. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Step-by-Step Construction**:\n",
            "   <START> While the prompt encourages a step-by-step approach, it could benefit from explicitly outlining the steps the agent should take to construct the SQL query. For example, steps could include identifying the relevant table, selecting the appropriate columns, and formulating the WHERE clause. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "By addressing these points, you can refine your prompt to guide the agent more effectively in generating accurate and relevant SQL queries.\n",
            "Use the critique smartly, refine the current prompt to make sure we dont get these examples wrong.\n",

            "\n",
            "5. **Ensure Syntax and Logical Coherence**: Write the SQL code with correct syntax and logical flow. Validate the SQL syntax to prevent errors and ensure that the query logically addresses the question.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Handle Edge Cases Gracefully**: If the query could return no results, ensure that your SQL statement accounts for this by returning NULL or a simple message, rather than complex conditional logic.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Output Format Alignment**: Ensure that the output format matches the expected result type (e.g., a single value, a list). The output should be a direct answer to the question, maintaining clarity and relevance.\n",
            "\n",
            "By following these steps, you will construct a precise SQL query that effectively answers the given question while maintaining clarity and relevance. Focus on returning the requested data directly, minimizing unnecessary complexity or additional commentary.\n",

            "[Question] what is the price of apple?\n",
            "[Answer] To construct the SQL query that answers the question \"what is the price of apple?\", we can follow a structured reasoning chain based on the provided task description and the example given. Here’s the improved reasoning chain:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Understand the Query Intent**: The question is asking for the price of a specific item, in this case, \"apple.\" The intent is to retrieve the price associated with the company or product named \"apple.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: We need to determine which table contains the relevant information about the price of \"apple.\" Based on the example, it seems we are looking at a table named `cio`, which likely contains information about companies, including their names and prices.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Select Relevant Columns**: The columns we need from the `cio` table are:\n",
            "   - `price`: This is the column that holds the price information.\n",
            "   - `company_name`: This column will be used to filter the results to only those related to \"apple.\"\n",
            "   - `suspension`: This column is used to check if the security is suspended, which affects the output.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Construct a Direct WHERE Clause**: We need to filter the results to only include rows where the `company_name` matches \"apple.\" Since the example uses a case-insensitive search, we will use the `ILIKE` operator to ensure we capture variations in case (e.g., \"Apple,\" \"APPLE\").\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Handle Suspended Securities**: The example includes a conditional check for the `suspension` column. If the value is 'Y', we need to return a specific message indicating that no information can be provided. If it is not suspended, we will return the price.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Simplify the SQL Statement**: We will use a `CASE` statement to handle the suspension check and return the price or the message accordingly. We will also ensure that we order the results by `rating_change_date` in descending order and limit the results to the most recent entry.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Ensure Syntax and Logical Coherence**: We will write the SQL query ensuring that it adheres to SQL syntax rules. We will also ensure that the logical flow of the query is coherent, meaning it should correctly filter, check conditions, and return the desired output.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Output Format Alignment**: The output should be a single value or message that directly answers the question. We will ensure that the result is clearly labeled as `result` for clarity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Based on this reasoning chain, the final SQL query constructed is:\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Understand the Query Intent**: The question is asking for the target price of Tesla. This indicates that we need to retrieve information related to Tesla's price target from a database.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: The example suggests that there is a table named `cio` that contains relevant information about companies, including their price targets. We need to focus on columns that likely contain the company name (e.g., `company_name`), the target price (which may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred), and possibly a column indicating if the information is available (e.g., `suspension`).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Construct a Direct WHERE Clause**: The query should filter results specifically for Tesla. This can be done using a WHERE clause that checks if the `company_name` matches 'Tesla'. The example uses `ILIKE` for case-insensitive matching, which is appropriate here.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Simplify the SQL Statement**: The example includes a CASE statement to handle different scenarios regarding the availability of the target price. If the `suspension` column indicates that the information is suspended (with a value of 'Y'), we need to return a specific message. Otherwise, we return a message indicating that the Chief Investment Office does not provide information about price targets.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Ensure Syntax and Logical Coherence**: The SQL syntax must be correct. The use of `CASE` is appropriate for handling conditional logic, and the `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results by `rating_change_date`, ensuring we get the most recent information.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Handle Edge Cases Gracefully**: The CASE statement effectively handles the edge case where the target price information is not available due to suspension. This ensures that the query does not return an error or irrelevant data.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Output Format Alignment**: The output is structured to return a single result with a clear message based on the conditions evaluated. This aligns with the expected output format of providing a direct answer to the question.\n",
