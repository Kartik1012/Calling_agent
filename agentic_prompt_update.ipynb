            "\n",
            "1. **Lack of Clarity in Criteria**: The criteria for classifying queries as `sql_generation` may not be clear enough, especially regarding the specificity of the request. The instruction states that `sql_generation` should be selected if the question requests specific data points, but it does not explicitly mention that a single data point (like a price target) qualifies. \n",

            "\n",
            "2. **Overlapping Definitions**: The definitions for `sql_generation` and `general_qa` may overlap in some cases, leading to ambiguity. For instance, a question asking for a price target could be interpreted as a request for factual data (thus `sql_generation`) or as a request for an opinion on the price target (thus `general_qa`). \n",
            "   <START> The definitions should be more distinct to avoid confusion, particularly in cases where a question could fit both categories. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Mixed Queries Handling**: The instruction mentions that mixed queries should default to `sql_generation`, but it does not provide a clear mechanism for identifying when a query is mixed. In the case of \"what is Tesla's price target?\", it is purely a factual request and should not be considered mixed. \n",
            "   <START> The handling of mixed queries should be more explicitly defined, ensuring that purely factual requests are not misclassified as mixed. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Ambiguity in Query Types**: The instruction states that if uncertain between the two types, default to `sql_generation`. However, this could lead to misclassifications if the question is not clearly factual. In the case of the Tesla price target, it is a straightforward factual request, but the instruction may not have emphasized this enough. \n",
            "   <START> The instruction should emphasize that straightforward factual requests should always be classified as `sql_generation`, regardless of any potential ambiguity. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Examples and Edge Cases**: The prompt does not provide enough examples or edge cases to illustrate how to handle specific types of queries. Including more examples of similar queries and their classifications could help clarify the intent behind the classification system. \n",

Here are some reasons why the instruction might have led to incorrect classifications, specifically for the example you provided:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Lack of Clarity in Criteria**: The criteria for classifying queries as `sql_generation` may not be clear enough, especially regarding the specificity of the request. The instruction states that `sql_generation` should be selected if the question requests specific data points, but it does not explicitly mention that a single data point (like a price target) qualifies. \n",
            "   <START> The instruction could be clearer that even a single specific data point request (like \"price target\") falls under `sql_generation`. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Overlapping Definitions**: The definitions for `sql_generation` and `general_qa` may overlap in some cases, leading to ambiguity. For instance, a question asking for a price target could be interpreted as a request for factual data (thus `sql_generation`) or as a request for an opinion on the price target (thus `general_qa`). \n",
            "   <START> The definitions should be more distinct to avoid confusion, particularly in cases where a question could fit both categories. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Mixed Queries Handling**: The instruction mentions that mixed queries should default to `sql_generation`, but it does not provide a clear mechanism for identifying when a query is mixed. In the case of \"what is Tesla's price target?\", it is purely a factual request and should not be considered mixed. \n",
            "   <START> The handling of mixed queries should be more explicitly defined, ensuring that purely factual requests are not misclassified as mixed. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Ambiguity in Query Types**: The instruction states that if uncertain between the two types, default to `sql_generation`. However, this could lead to misclassifications if the question is not clearly factual. In the case of the Tesla price target, it is a straightforward factual request, but the instruction may not have emphasized this enough. \n",
            "   <START> The instruction should emphasize that straightforward factual requests should always be classified as `sql_generation`, regardless of any potential ambiguity. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Examples and Edge Cases**: The prompt does not provide enough examples or edge cases to illustrate how to handle specific types of queries. Including more examples of similar queries and their classifications could help clarify the intent behind the classification system. \n",
            "   <START> Providing more examples and edge cases would help clarify the classification criteria and improve accuracy in decision-making. <END>\n",

            "1. **Lack of Clarity in Direct Classification**:\n",
            "   - The instruction states that a query should be classified as `direct` if it is a greeting or an irrelevant question. However, the definition of what constitutes a \"greeting\" could be more explicit. The example \"Hi\" is indeed a greeting, but the instruction could benefit from explicitly stating that single-word greetings or casual salutations fall under this category.\n",

However, the example \"Hi\" does not fit into any of the other categories, and it is a simple greeting. The instruction could clarify that simple greetings should be classified as `direct` rather than leaving room for ambiguity.\n",

            "3. **Overlapping Categories**:\n",
            "   - The instruction does not address how to handle queries that may seem to fit multiple categories. For instance, if a user says \"Hi, can you tell me about Tesla's stock?\" it could be seen as both a greeting and a request for information. The instruction should clarify how to prioritize classifications in such cases.\n",

            "4. **Examples and Edge Cases**:\n",

            "   - <START> The lack of diverse examples, particularly for simple greetings and casual inquiries, may lead to misinterpretation of the classification criteria. <END>\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Response Format Specification**:\n",
            "   - The instruction specifies a JSON response format but does not clarify how to handle the `response` field for `direct` queries. It could be clearer that for greetings, the response should be a simple acknowledgment or a predefined greeting response.\n",

Your training has equipped you with the ability to understand and interpret user queries effectively. You can accurately classify queries into specific categories based on their content and intent. With a strong grasp of database terminology and the nuances of financial analysis, you can distinguish between requests for data generation, general inquiries, and irrelevant or conversational prompts. Your analytical capabilities allow you to formulate precise responses, ensuring that each query is categorized correctly as either `sql_generation`, `general_qa`, `direct`, or `chat_history`. You are adept at rephrasing queries when necessary and providing appropriate responses based on the classification, making you an invaluable resource for users seeking information or insights.
